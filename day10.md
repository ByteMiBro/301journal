Imperative programming is what we've been doing now we are going to use Functional Programming. Now we don't have to always repeat our selves to specify everything to the computer. Please don't use string interpolation, instead use the query we've practiced in the labs, the group 935 labs.


Immutability and mutability- don't mutate data.

 declarative vs imperative programing,


Immediately Invoked Function Expressions module pattern for creating local scope within the file, and handling back out to a higher level of scope. That way folks in the out side don't mess with us.
