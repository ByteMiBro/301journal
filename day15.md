I've learned to ask myself "do I understand enough to write one more line of code and make it work, and repeat". This has been helpful in breaking down my code. I also have learned that if I get stuck, I need to break down the meaning of the code and write it in comments above that code, and if I get to a peace of code that I can't discern the meaning of then that's when I ask a question. These 2 methods have proven to me that I don't need to get a big mental picture of the code in order to write my code, I just need to break down the meaning of the code I'm trying to write, and break it down one line at a time.
