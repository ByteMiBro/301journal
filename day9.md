SQL is all about set based manipulation- inner join, the base reason for this philosophy. set theory is just math equations.


****Notes****
SQL injection- never put user input into the value of the query, instead use parameterized queries.


Normalization - decomposing a table into smaller, less redundant tables without losing information. Use foreign keys in old table to refer to the primary key in the new table.

storage and space is extremely cheep right now so prefer more tables and better data rather than saving space.

NEVER put text on a jpg. If you are going to create a print out doc. do not make it a jpg, instead make it a pdf or png.

we only want one set of html that renders differently for different layouts. However, for goal oriented purposes, create two layouts that work first, then bring them together.


Can use illustrator to make drawings.

use visibility hidden to make an element hidden without taking it out of the flow of the document.

show all elements first and then remove them individually, or hide all elements and then show them individually.
